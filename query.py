# Part 2: Discussion Questions


# 1. What is the datatype of the returned value of
# ``Brand.query.filter_by(name='Ford')``?

# it is a python object:  <class 'flask_sqlalchemy.BaseQuery'>



# 2. In your own words, what is an association table, and what type of
# relationship (many to one, many to many, one to one, etc.) does an
# association table manage?

# An association table is  table between two tables with many-to-many
# relationships which, unlike a middle table, contains no other data
# besides the foreign keys to link to two many-to-many tables together.

# Part 3: SQLAlchemy Queries

# Get the brand with the brand_id of ``ram``.
q1 = Brand.query.filter_by(brand_id='ram').one()

# Get all models with the name ``Corvette`` and the brand_id ``che``.
q2 = Model.query.filter_by(name='Corvette', brand_id='che').all()

# Get all models that are older than 1960.
q3 = Model.query.filter(Model.year > 1960).all()

# Get all brands that were founded after 1920.
q4 = Brand.query.filter(Brand.founded > 1920).all()

# Get all models with names that begin with ``Cor``.
q5 = q5 = Model.query.filter(Model.name.like('Cor%')).all()

# Get all brands that were founded in 1903 and that are not yet discontinued.
q6 = Brand.query.filter(Brand.founded==1903, Brand.discontinued.is_(None)).all()

# before 1950.
